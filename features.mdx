## Document Creation and Editing Tools

Start new documents from templates or blank pages. The visual editor supports drag-and-drop components, while the code view lets you write raw MDX.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Page" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and click `New Page`. Choose a template like "API Reference" or start blank.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Components" icon="components">
    Use the sidebar to insert `<Callout>`, `<Tabs>`, or other elements. Preview changes live.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish" icon="upload">
    Save and publish. Changes go live instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here is a basic MDX example you can copy into your page:

<CodeGroup tabs="MDX,JSX">
```mdx
<Callout kind="info">
  This is a sample callout.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Glitch!");
```
```
```jsx
<Callout kind="info">
  This is a sample callout.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

const greeting = "Hello, Glitch!";
console.log(greeting);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use `{frontmatter}` at the top of every page for metadata like `title` and `description`.
</Callout>

## Organization with Folders and Tags

Keep your docs structured. Create folders for sections like "Guides" or "API". Add tags such as `feature` or `guide` for easy categorization.

| Feature       | Description                          | Example Tags          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Folders       | Nested organization                 | `/guides/quickstart` |
| Tags          | Cross-reference content             | `["api", "feature"]` |
| Searchable    | Filter by multiple tags             | `guide + beginner`   |

Assign tags in the page editor:

````mdx
---
title: My Guide
tags: ["guide", "beginner"]
---
````

## Collaboration and Real-Time Editing

Invite team members to edit simultaneously. Changes appear live, with cursor indicators and version history.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Collaborators" icon="user-plus">
    Share your workspace URL or add emails in settings. Collaborators see a `Join` button.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-Time Edits" icon="edit-3">
    Multiple cursors show who edits what. Use `@mentions` for comments: `@team review this section`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Version History" icon="git-branch">
    Revert changes or compare versions from the history panel.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="success">
  Real-time sync works across devices with `<100ms` latency.
</Callout>

## Search and Filtering Capabilities

Glitch's search indexes all pages, tags, and content. Filter by tags, folders, or keywords.

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="true">
    Use operators like `tag:api` or `folder:guides title:quickstart`.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Saved Filters">
    Pin frequent searches like "all `bugfix` updates".
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>
